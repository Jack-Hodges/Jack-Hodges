# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jack-Hodges

I am a student studying Bachelor of Computing & Bachelor of Medical Science at The Australian National University!
I'm currently working on a few projects, let me tell you about three of them!

1. SaveEasy ðŸ’° is an app created to help motivate kids to save money! Parents can monitor their child's saving and post jobs for them to earn money! SaveEasy is designed to make saving money feel like a game, and let kids be in control of their savings, allowing them to better visualise their progress.

2. Cardify ðŸ“š is a flashcard app! I am creating this one primarily for my own use at university. It is built with a very fun user interface to motivate me, and other students, to study more.

3. CashFlow ðŸ’¸ is a checkout app. Created to make the POS sales system as easy as possible, while working on iPad and iPhone.

I'm working on a few more projects behind the scenes, you'll see more when I get to working!
