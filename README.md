# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jack-Hodges

I am a student studying Bachelor of Computing & Bachelor of Medical Science! (strange combination, I know, but I hope to do something along the lines of biotech, or I might just choose one!)

I'm currently working on a few projects, the only one you can see right now is SaveEasy ðŸ’° Check it out!
